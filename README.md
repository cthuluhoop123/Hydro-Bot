# Hydro-Bot
Hello and welcome to Hydro-Bot. Setup is simple.

Create a new file called ``credentials.json`` and put this in it:
```
{
  "token": "Your discord token. Compulsory.",
  "sharedSecret": "Your steam shared secret. Optional."
}
``` 

Create another file called ``data.json`` and put this in it:
```
{}
```

Remember to save them both. 

To start the bot, go into a text channel and type in ``;init``. Good luck.
