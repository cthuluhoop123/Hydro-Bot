# Hydro-Bot
Hello and welcome to Hydro-Bot. Setup is simple.

Create a new file called ``credentials.json`` and put this in it:
```
{
  "token": "Your discord token. Compulsory.",
  "offloadBotToken": "Your offloading bot token. Optional but strongly recommended",
  "sharedSecret": "Your steam shared secret. Optional."
}
``` 
Notes: 
* An offload bot is a bot that sends all the logs in place of you. In case of a massive bulk delete, your account won't get suspended/banned.
* Put the avatars you want to rotate in your avatar folder (You might need to create it in the bot's root directory).*

Create another file called ``data.json`` and put this in it:
```
{}
```

Remember to save them both. 

To start the bot, go into a text channel and type in ``;init``. Good luck.
